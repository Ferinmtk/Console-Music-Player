# üéµ Simple C++ Music Player

A basic command-line music player written in **C++17** using the **SFML Audio** library.
It supports loading playlists, adding songs, playing, pausing, skipping, and saving your music list.

---

## Features

* Play `.ogg` or `.wav` audio files
* Load and save playlists from a file
* Add songs manually or automatically
* Control playback (Play, Pause, Stop, Next, Previous)
* Adjustable volume
* Loop mode toggle
* Uses C++ classes, STL vectors, conditionals, loops, and file I/O

---

##  Requirements

* **Fedora Linux** (or any Linux with GCC & SFML)
* **SFML Audio library**
* **C++17 compiler**

Install dependencies:

```bash
sudo dnf install sfml-devel ffmpeg
```

 Folder Structure

```
music_player/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.cpp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ player
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ playlist.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ songs/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ track1.ogg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ track2.ogg
```

---

##  Playlist Format

Each line in `playlist.txt` should contain a valid relative path to a song file:

```
songs/ETHIC - PANDANA.ogg
songs/Lil Uzi Vert - You Was Right.ogg
```

---

##  Compilation

Compile with:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o player -lsfml-audio -lsfml-system
```

---

## ‚ñ∂ Running

Run the program:

```bash
./player
```

If the playlist is in place, load it with:

```
L
```

Then play music:

```
P
```
